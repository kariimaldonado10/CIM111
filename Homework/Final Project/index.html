<h3 align=center><strong><font color="white"><u>WHAT IS PUBLIC RELATIONS? </u></h3>

  <h4>While many organizations understand that PR is a great way to build on their marketing strategies and improve their online reputation, very few know about what PR involves. Most importantly they fail to realize why certain companies invest so much time and effort into staying on top of their strategies. Public relations is about sending the right messages to the right places and people, to build your brand reputation. That is why you should contact Maldonado's PR Department today, because when used correctly, PR can make or break a company – giving it the power to overcome almost any obstacle.</h4>

<h3 align=center><strong><font color="white"><u>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? </u></h3>

   <h3 align=center><strong><font color="white"><u>1. PUBLIC RELATIONS INCREASES BRAND CREDIBILITY</u> <br>

<h4>In any industry, trust is integral in determining whether a business will be successful. A lack of trust could mean that a brand loses opportunities for sales. However, when they hire someone in public relations, those experts can work on increasing credibility by improving an organization’s reputation through thought leadership pieces, influencer connections, and networking strategies.</h4> <br>

2. <u>INCREASE PROFITS, SALES, AND LEADS</u> <br>

<h4>When you enhance your reputation through a range of unique PR activities, you make it more likely that new potential customers will find their way to your door. Your customers will find more ways to connect with your business through business stories and press releases and PR agencies will help you to craft the right messages to resonate with your target customer in the best possible way.</h4> <br>


3. <u>PR CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU</u> <br>

<h4>The problem with the online world is that people can say anything they want about a company – regardless of whether it’s true or not, and there’s very little that a business can do about it. Some businesses get a bad reputation unfairly, while other organizations aren’t on the right people’s radar. Both circumstances might not be ideal and focusing on the right campaigns and PR support can raise awareness for your brand in all the right ways.
