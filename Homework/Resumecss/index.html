<p> My name is Karina Maldonado, I am currently 21 years old and I am a junior at the University of Miami studying Communications and Public Relations. I started off studying at the Florida International University (FIU) but I did not like it so i decided to transfer last year. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela and moved to the United States when I was eight years old. I am an office assistant at a digital marketing company called IBIS Studio where I manage their social media account as well as some of our clients. I speak both Spanish and English fluently and I am a very outgoing person who loves going to the beach, eating good food, going to the gym and meeting new people. I am the middle child and have a jack russel who is three years old who I am obsessed with.  </p>
